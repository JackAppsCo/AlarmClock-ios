"The Science Behind SleepSmart – Why Your Sleep Cycle Matters\n\nThink that extra hour of sleep will make you feel more rested?  Think again.  Research has shown that waking up in the middle of your body’s natural sleep cycle can make you feel groggy, disoriented and is actually counterproductive to a full night’s sleep.  Waking your body up at the end of your natural sleep cycle, when your body and brain are already close to wakefulness, can provide you with the best night’s sleep and the most refreshing of mornings.\n\nThe average sleep cycle lasts approximately 90 minutes and a well-rested adult goes through approximately 4-6 cycles a night.  During these cycles your body enters four different stages: N1, transition to sleep (5 min); N2, light sleep (10-25 min); N3, deep sleep (40-60 min); and REM, dream sleep.  Each stage is vital in restoring your body and mind and plays a different role in preparing you for the day ahead.\n\nEven if you’ve enjoyed a full night’s sleep, getting out of bed can be difficult if your alarm goes off when you’re in the middle of deep sleep (stage N3).   If you want the best night’s sleep for an optimal morning, then set your alarm to wake up at the end of your natural sleep cycle.  Simply use SleepSmart’s Sleep Cycle Calculator and you’re on your way to a great night’s sleep!" = "The Science Behind SleepSmart – Why Your Sleep Cycle Matters\n\nThink that extra hour of sleep will make you feel more rested?
