"Think that extra hour of sleep will make you feel more rested?  Think again.  Research has shown that waking up in the middle of your body’s natural sleep cycle can make you feel groggy, disoriented and is actually counterproductive to a full night’s sleep.  Waking your body up at the end of your natural sleep cycle, when your body and brain are already close to wakefulness, can provide you with the best night’s sleep and the most refreshing of mornings.\n\nThe average sleep cycle lasts approximately 90 minutes and a well-rested adult goes through approximately 4-6 cycles a night.  During these cycles your body enters four different stages: N1, transition to sleep (5 min); N2, light sleep (10-25 min); N3, deep sleep (40-60 min); and REM, dream sleep.  Each stage is vital in restoring your body and mind and plays a different role in preparing you for the day ahead.\n\nEven if you’ve enjoyed a full night’s sleep, getting out of bed can be difficult if your alarm goes off when you’re in the middle of deep sleep (stage N3).   If you want the best night’s sleep for an optimal morning, then set your alarm to wake up at the end of your natural sleep cycle.  Simply use SleepSmart’s Sleep Cycle Calculator and you’re on your way to a great night’s sleep!" = "想想你额外睡眠时间将让你有更多的休息吗再想想。调查显示在你身体自然睡眠周期里如果醒来会让你头昏眼花的，没有方向感并且是与你晚间所有的睡眠自然地事与愿反。在你自然睡眠的末期唤醒你的身体，当你的身体和大脑已经接近清醒，这可以给你提供一个最好的晚间睡眠，并且早上清爽.\n\n平均睡眠周期持续大概90分钟并且一个休息很好地成年人在一个晚上经历4-6个周期。在这些周期里，你的身体进入4个不同的状态：N1,转移到睡眠（5分钟）；N2，轻度睡眠（10-25分钟）；N3,深度睡眠（40-60分钟）；和保持，深度梦睡中。每个阶段在恢复你的身体和身心中很重要并且起着不同的作用帮你准备迎接新的一天.\n\n甚至你享受了整晚的睡眠，你起床时，但还在睡眠中（第三阶段）你的闹铃响了，你会觉得很困难起床。如果你想在早上有最佳状态在晚上有最好的睡眠，那么设置你的闹铃在你自然睡眠周期的尾部唤醒你。简单使用智能睡眠睡眠周期计算器，你就能达到你最佳夜间睡眠效果！";
